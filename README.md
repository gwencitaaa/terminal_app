# terminal_app
Docs for terminal app for Mahdi, Paul and Gwenny

# brainstorm
Concept: 
- app 'Where should I eat dinner?'
- recommends a restaurant nearby based on user input

Ethical considerations/societal impact:
- using publicly available data
- no IPP (identifying) data being used
= therefore, minimal societal impact 

Outcomes for MVP:
- take user input
- return a restaurant suggestion based on input 
  - Trading name, address, type of food
  
Outside MVP if time: 
- how expensive e.g. $$ vs $$$ (5 scale?)
- rating (Based on review?) e.g. 5 stars? 

Notes from rubric meeting (info not clear from rubric):
- 5 mins EXCL. questions
- 80% should be app walk through (check—in slide deck or live demo??)
- take screenshots of convos in slack / Trello and put in here
- record all working notes in here

# Responsibilities of group members
Discussed Tues. AM before doing structure
Everyone should add updates of what they're doing in this readme + commit as soon as changes are made
For code changes, everyone should commit once running successfully—show one other group member before doing so (live demo)
For Trello, members tick off their own tasks when done + upload screenshot to here.
